```
series_sum = 0.0
num_terms = 10000

for i in range(num_terms):
    denominator = 2 * i + 1
    term = ((-1)**i) / denominator
    series_sum += term

result = series_sum * 4

print(f"The sum of the first {num_terms} terms multiplied by 4 is: {result}")

Output:
The sum of the first 10000 terms multiplied by 4 is: 3.1414926535900345
