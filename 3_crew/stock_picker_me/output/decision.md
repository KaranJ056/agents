The chosen company for investment is Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) due to its market leadership, strong financial health, and consistent dividend payouts, making it a good long-term investment with a recommendation for staggered accumulation.

**Detailed Report:**

**Chosen Company:** Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)

**Rationale:**

*   **Market Leadership:** TCS is the largest IT services company in India by market capitalization, holding a dominant position within the industry.
