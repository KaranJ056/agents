AI LLMs pose a profound threat to humanity primarily through two vectors: the unprecedented proliferation of sophisticated, undetectable misinformation and propaganda, capable of eroding trust, manipulating public opinion, and destabilizing democracies at a global scale. Secondly, as LLMs become more autonomous and integrated into critical infrastructure, they present an escalating risk of catastrophic miscalculation, accidental malicious behavior, or weaponization by bad actors, leading to societal collapse, economic disruption, or even direct physical harm by enabling advanced cyberwarfare, bio-weapon design, or autonomous decision-making without adequate human oversight. This loss of control and the erosion of a shared reality represent an existential danger to our collective future.
